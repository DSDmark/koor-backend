    A view for displaying a list of countries.

            case, only authenticated users are allowed to access the view.

        - serializer_class (CountrySerializers): The serializer class used for data validation and serialization.

        - queryset (QuerySet): The queryset that the view should use to retrieve the countries. By default, it is set
            to retrieve all countries using `Country.objects.all()`.

        - filter_backends ([filters.SearchFilter]): List of filter backends to use for filtering the queryset. In this
            case, only `SearchFilter` is used.

        - search_fields (list): List of fields to search for in the queryset. In this case, the field is "title".
